            <h5>Biography</h5>
            <p>I am a student at SAIT in the interactive design program majoring in User Experience. I am passionate about design and have worked on some UX and UI in my previous career. I am a student at SAIT looking to grow my skillset and find employment in the industry as a designer. When I am not designing you can also find me drawing on my IPad. I am a major anime, comic and videogame fan and you will sometimes find me at the odd convention here and there selling some of my fanart!</p>
            <h3>Current Goals</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Become a UX Designer</li>
                <li>Learn how to code</li>
                <li>Continue improving my art</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As part of this program I have learned many skills that are relevant to the industry. Some of these skills include industry standard programs such as photoshop and illustrator. I have also started and continue to improve my skills using HTML and CSS
