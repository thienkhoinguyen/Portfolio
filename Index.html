        <H3>Biography</H3>
        <p>I am a student at SAIT in the interactive design program majoring in User Experience. I am passionate about design and have worked on some UX and UI in my previous career. I look to grow my skillset and find employment in the industry as a designer. When I am not designing you can also find me drawing on my IPad. I am a major anime, comic and videogame fan and you will sometimes find me at the odd convention here and there selling some of my fanart!</p>
